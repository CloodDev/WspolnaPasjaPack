**mc-modpack-kit** is a GitHub Actions workflow template designed to streamline the release process of Minecraft modpacks. It automates tasks like version extraction, building the modpack, and publishing it to platforms like Modrinth and CurseForge.

## Features

- Automates the modpack release process using GitHub Actions workflows.
- Extracts loader type and game version information from `pack.toml` files.
- Builds the modpack using the `packwiz` tool.
- Publishes the modpack to Modrinth and CurseForge platforms.
- Provides an update workflow for managing modpack updates.

## Usage

1. **Fork this repository:** Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Set up secrets and permissions:**
     In your forked repository, go to "Settings" -> "Secrets" and add the following secrets:

   - `MODRINTH_TOKEN`: Token for authenticating with Modrinth.
   - `MODRINTH_ID`: Modrinth project ID.
   - `CURSEFORGE_TOKEN`: Token for authenticating with CurseForge.
   - `CURSEFORGE_ID`: CurseForge project ID.
  
    For permissions in your forked repository, go to "Settings" -> "Actions" -> "General" -> "Workflow permissions".
    Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

3. **Initializing your modpack:**

   - Before you start, make sure to initialize your modpack by generating a `pack.toml` file using the `packwiz` tool. You can use the following command:
     ```
     packwiz init
     ```

4. **Clear and Informative Commit Messages:**
   - Maintain a well-documented history with [**Conventional Commit Messages**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
   - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
     - Example: `feat(mod): add new mod`

5. **Release Please Automation:**
   - Streamline your releases even further with Release Please.
   - Automatically generate changelogs and handle versioning by following Conventional Commits.
   - Push changes to `main`, and Release Please will create PRs with changes since the last release.
   - Merge PRs for new versions, and Release Please will manage versioning and changelogs.

6. **Update Workflow:**

   The project also includes an update workflow that helps you manage modpack updates more efficiently:

   - **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/update.yml`
   - **Description:** Automatically updates the modpack by checking for changes in the `pack.toml` file.

   To use the update workflow:

   1. Enable the update workflow by uncommenting and customizing the necessary sections in `.github/workflows/update.yml`.
   2. Trigger the update workflow manually or set up a schedule to check for updates periodically.
